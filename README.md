# Linear Data Structures Sample Code
From BPT training session 1, 2022-10-12

## Where to find everything

### Linked list vs. dynamic array (vector/ArrayList) comparison
C++:
* If you're using Visual Studio (2019 or newer) you can open `linkedList/CppLL/BPT_LL/BPT_LL.sln` with that app to easily run the code.
* Otherwise, you can open `linkedList/CppLL/LinkedList.cpp` in the text editor/IDE of your choice. It is the same code in the Visual Studio version.

Java: Open `linkedList/JavaLL/Solution.java` in whichever text editor/IDE you prefer

### Bracket matching problem

C++:
* If you're using Visual Studio (2019 or newer) you can open `brackets/CPPBrackets/BPT_Stack/BPT_Stack.sln` in that app
* Otherwise, you can open `brackets/CPPBrackets/Brackets.cpp` in the text editor/IDE of your choice.

Java: Open `brackets/JavaBrackets/Solution.java` in whichever text editor/IDE you prefer

Description of the problem from the presentation:
> Given a string containing only brackets '(', ')', '[', ']', '{' and '}',
> output "Correct" if the brackets are valid, or "Incorrect" if they are invalid.
