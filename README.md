## Where to find everything

### Presentation slides
`presentation/`
* The pptx version has the animations, the pdf version does not. If you don't have Microsoft Powerpoint, you should be able to open the pptx file with Google Slides to see the animations.

### Linked list vs. dynamic array (vector/ArrayList) comparison
C++:
* If you're using Visual Studio (2019 or newer) you can open `linkedList/CppLL/BPT_LL/BPT_LL.sln` with that app to easily run the code.
* Otherwise, you can open `linkedList/CppLL/LinkedList.cpp` in the text editor/IDE of your choice. It is the same code in the Visual Studio version.

Java: Open `linkedList/JavaLL/Solution.java` in whichever text editor/IDE you prefer

### Bracket matching problem

C++:
* If you're using Visual Studio (2019 or newer) you can open `brackets/CPPBrackets/BPT_Stack/BPT_Stack.sln` in that app
* Otherwise, you can open `brackets/CPPBrackets/Brackets.cpp` in the text editor/IDE of your choice.

Java: Open `brackets/JavaBrackets/Solution.java` in whichever text editor/IDE you prefer

Description of the problem from the presentation:
> Given a string containing only brackets '(', ')', '[', ']', '{' and '}',
> output "Correct" if the brackets are valid, or "Incorrect" if they are invalid.
